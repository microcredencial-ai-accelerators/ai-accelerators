# Microcredencial AI Accelerators for Reconfigurable Technologies: Specific Design Flows for Implementing AI Algorithms on Reconfigurable Devices
## [Back to index](index.md)

## Introduction

Using the Terasic DE10-Nano (Cyclone V SoC) as the reference platform, this module explains how to develop and structure an OpenCL host application, manage data movement between the host processor and the FPGA, compile OpenCL kernels, and deploy both the application and the kernels on the target board.

The goal is to provide a practical, hands-on understanding of how OpenCL can be used to implement and execute neural network components on FPGA-based systems.

The module also covers how to build a Deep Learning Processor using MATLAB tools and how to deploy a neural network accelerator on the Intel Arria 10 SoC Development Kit.
